# Introduction

The [Permissonless Software Foundation](https://psfoundation.info) File Pinning Protocol (PSFFPP) is a system for [pinning](https://dweb-primer.ipfs.io/files-on-ipfs/pin-files) files on the [IPFS network](https://ipfs.tech/). Files are redundantly stored on multiple internet servers, for fast and reliable access. Files are stored for at least one year, at a cost of around $0.01 USD per megabyte of data. File hosting can be renewed, to extend the hosting past one year.

## Community

The protocol, code, and infrastructure to support the PSFFPP is maintained by the PSF community. They primarily communicate over [the PSF Telegram channel](https://t.me/permissionless_software) and [the PSF GitHub repositories](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation).

# Introduction

The [Permissonless Software Foundation](https://psfoundation.info) File Pinning Protocol (**PSFFPP**) is a system for [pinning](https://dweb-primer.ipfs.io/files-on-ipfs/pin-files) files on the [IPFS network](https://ipfs.tech/). Files are redundantly stored on multiple internet servers, for fast and reliable access. Files can be up to 100 MB, are stored for at least one year, and cost of around $0.01 USD per megabyte of data. File hosting can be renewed, to extend the hosting past one year.

## How to Use
You can upload files to the PSFFPP network at [explorer.psffpp.com](https://explorer.psffpp.com). You'll need some Bitcoin Cash (BCH) as well as some PSF tokens. PSF tokens can be purchased for BCH at [PSFoundation.cash](https://psfoundation.cash).

## Community

The protocol, code, and infrastructure to support the PSFFPP is maintained by the PSF community. They primarily communicate over [the PSF Telegram channel](https://t.me/permissionless_software) and [the PSF GitHub repositories](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation).
